# networkchecker
Network activity monitoring

### Run Program
To run the program, you must first run it in a Python environment. Here are the steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and the psutil library installed. (Install via pip for example "pip install psutil")

2. Open a console or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the program.

3. Run the program by typing "py networkchecker.py" in the console.

After you run the program, you should see the output showing the number of bytes sent and received.

### How it works
The number of bytes sent and received indicates how much data is being sent and received over the network. The bytes readings show how much network traffic is occurring on your system and can be helpful in monitoring network activity and in performance diagnostics.

For example, if you see a high number of bytes sent, it may indicate that a lot of data is being sent from your system to other devices, while a high number of bytes received indicates that a lot of data is being received onto your system from other devices.

This information can help you identify and fix network problems, and can also be helpful in monitoring network performance and capacity.
